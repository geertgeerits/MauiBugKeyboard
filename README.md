Bug report.
Issue: https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/22715

Controls slide up when using the keyboard in iOS. The text in the first label is no longer fully visible.
The last correct version was 8.0.6. In version 8.0.7 the controls moved down a few millimeters. From version 8.0.10 to 8.0.40 the controls moved up about half a centimeter.
